# NHPP-for-FRBs

This code implements the non-homogeneous poisson process model for estimating the rate of fast radio bursts. It includes modeling terms for the distribution of events in the Universe and the detection sensitivity of the radio telescopes and arrays used in observation. The model is described in LA-UR-16-26261. This paper has been submitted to The Astronomical Journal.
